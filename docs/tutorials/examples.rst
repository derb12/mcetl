Example Data & Programs
=======================

mcetl comes with the ability to generate raw data to emulate several different materials
characterization techniques. Further, example programs are available to show basic
usage of mcetl.


Generating Example Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files for example data from characterization techniques can be created using:

.. code-block:: python

    from mcetl import raw_data
    raw_data.generate_raw_data()


Data produced by the generate_raw_data function covers the following characterization techniques:

* X-ray diffraction (XRD)
* Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
* Raman spectroscopy
* Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
* Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
* Rheometry
* Uniaxial tensile tests
* Pore size measurements


Example Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Example programs`_  are available to show basic usage of mcetl. The examples include:

* Generating raw data
* Using the main GUI
* Using the fitting GUI
* Using the plotting GUI
* Reopening a figure saved with the plotting GUI


The example program for using the main GUI contains all necessary inputs for processing the
example raw data generated by the generate_raw_data function as described above and is an
excellent resource for creating new DataSource objects.
