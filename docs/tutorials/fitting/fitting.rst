Fitting Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the fitting module in mcetl, simply do:

.. code-block:: python

    from mcetl import fitting
    fitting.launch_peak_fitting_gui()


A window will then appear to select the data file(s) to be fit and the Excel file for saving the results.
No other setup is required for doing fitting.

After doing the fitting, the fit results and plots will be saved to Excel.
