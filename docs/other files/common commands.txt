To bump the version:
1)	Navigate to the project folder (mcetl)
2)	python -m  bumpversion [version]
where [version] is major if moving from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0, minor if moving from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, and patch if moving from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1.

To print out the git changes for the development branch:
1)	Navigate to the project folder (mcetl)
2)	git log development --oneline --decorate --color v[version]^ --
where [version] is the last released version, eg. 0.1.1.

To create the .tar.gz file and the wheel:
1)	Navigate to the project folder (mcetl)
2)	python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

To upload to pypi:
1)	Navigate to the project folder (mcetl)
2)	python -m twine upload dist/*

To investigate import timing:
1)	python -X importtime -c "import [module]" 2> [log file]
where [module] is what needs imported, such as mcetl, and [log file] is the output log name, such as mcetl.log
2)	tuna [log file]
tuna is a library available by installing from pypi. It makes a nice display of the output from step 1).
